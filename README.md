Dear viewer,

This is a CV template created with React, React-Router and Tailwind. 

Project was bootstrapped with Create react app

The app loads information from a backend ( Firebase) and places it into a layout. 

It: 
- has a mobile first approach
- loads all initially unnecessary components lazily
- has a loading spinner
- displays and error page for ( one for generic network erros and one for 404 page not found)
- allows you to copy a contact email straight from the Contats page

Used dependencies:
- React
- React-Router-Dom
- Tailwind
- react-scroll
- react-typical
- react-spinners
- use-copy custom hook

Things to bear in mind:
 - testing is yet to be added

Please leave a comment.

Thank you!
